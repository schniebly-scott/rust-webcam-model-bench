# Rust Webcam Model Bench
### Test ONNX computer vision models easily

**Currently only works on Linux, since the webcam library is based on v4l2**

In future upgrades:
- Windows support will be added
- more model types supported
- more configuration for output available (bounding boxes, pose tracking, etc.)
